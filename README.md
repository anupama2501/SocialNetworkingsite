# SocialNetworkingsite
This was created using OSSN - open source social networking which lets us use our own components (extra features we want on our social networking site including the ones provided by OSSN). I created a component dashboard which lets people raise requests or concerns faced by them in a particular area. This also shows the number of requests that have been generated in a month.
The folders above can be zipped and included in OSSN as is and it works with the OSSN version v3.01.
